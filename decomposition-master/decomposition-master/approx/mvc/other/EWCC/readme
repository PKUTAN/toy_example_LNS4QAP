EWCC is a solver for the minimum vertex cover problem.

1. The input format
The input graph is asked to be in ascii format. A samll exmple is given as follow:
p edge 4 3
e 1 2
e 1 3
e 2 4

2. The parameter file
EWCC also needs a parameter file to run on.
The parameter file is named as "parameter.txt", and it should contain the following 3 terms: the graph file name, max steps, the optimal size of vertex cover (optional). Here is an example:
frb59-26-1.mis
400000000
1475 

If the optimal size of vertex cover is provided, then EWCC will terminate as soon as it finds a optimal vertex cover before it reaches max steps. 
And if the optimal size of vertex cover is set to 0, EWCC will terminate only when it reaches max steps. In this case, a parameter file is like this:
frb59-26-1.mis
400000000
0

3. Usage
EWCC is a local search and break ties randomly which needs a random seed, so the command to run EWCC is: ./EWCC <random seed value>. For example: ./EWCC 46 will run EWCC with the random seed 46.
