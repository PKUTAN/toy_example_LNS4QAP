# Helpful Scripts

Several additional scripts are included with the MQLib that may prove useful to researchers:

* [scripts/benchmark.py](benchmark.py): A script that can be run to perform the LINPACK 100 benchmark on a computer, measuring its flop count. Please see the comments at the top of the script file for how to perform the benchmark (setup involves downloading and compiling Fortran code).
* [scripts/downloadAllGraphs.py](downloadAllGraphs.py): A script to download all graphs from the publicly accessible `mqlibinstances` S3 bucket. This script can be run with `python downloadAllGraphs.py outputFolder`. Running this script requires the `boto` python package to be installed (though it does not require an Amazon Web Services account); see the boto installation instructions in the [Reproducible Parallel Computation with Amazon Web Services guide](../Cloud/README.md) for details about how to install boto. **Warning**: Even though the graphs are zipped, this script will download and store roughly 10 GB of files.
* [scripts/downloadGraph.py](downloadGraph.py): A script to download a single graph from the publicly accessible `mqlibinstances` S3 bucket, outputting its contents. A common use case would be redirecting this output to a file with something like `python downloadGraph.py g000002.zip > g000002.zip`. Running this script requires the `boto` python package to be installed (though it does not require an Amazon Web Services account); see the boto installation instructions in the [Reproducible Parallel Computation with Amazon Web Services guide](../Cloud/README.md) for details about how to install boto.
* [scripts/list_graphs.py](list_graphs.py): A script to list the names of all graphs stored in the publicly accessible `mqlibinstances` S3 bucket. Running this script requires the `boto` python package to be installed (though it does not require an Amazon Web Services account); see the boto installation instructions in the [Reproducible Parallel Computation with Amazon Web Services guide](../Cloud/README.md) for details about how to install boto. Note that this list is also available through the `graphname` column of the [data/runtimes.csv](../data/runtimes.csv) or [data/metrics.csv](../data/metrics.csv) files.
